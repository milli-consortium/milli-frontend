## 🚀 Getting started

If you prefer you can clone this repository and run the following commands inside the project folder:

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `yarn start:gql` to start the mock-graphql server
1. Run `yarn gql:update` to generate typings for the graphql queries
1. Run `yarn start` to start the dev environment

To view the project you can open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes

- If you make a change to a query, rerun `yarn gql:update` to regenerate the typescript typings
  - if not, your changes won't reflect in your auto-complete
- if you make a change to the schema, restart `yarn start:gql`
  - re-run `yarn gql:fetch` to download the JSON version of the schema from the mock schema
  - commit `schema.sdl` and `graphql-schema.json` in the same git-commit
  - re-run `gql:update` if needed
